This repository contains material for the composition course, EDSD cohort 2024-2025.

It contains the slides and the exercises for each day. 
For each exercise are included:
- a dataset
- an R file, which contains the code for the exercise
- an RMarkdown file, which includes both walk-through explanation and code
- a PDF file, which was knitted from the RMarkdown file

During class, we will be talking about some papers that apply decomposition methods. You are not required to read, but should you wish to do so, here is the list.

If you are interested in the topic of decomposition, here you can find the PhD thesis by Vladimir Canudas-Romo: https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/10068144/thesis.pdf. It is an interesting, if challening, read.
