This repository contains material for the composition course, EDSD cohort 2024-2025.

It contains the slides and the exercises for each day. 
For each exercise are included:
- a dataset
- an R file, which contains the code for the exercise
- an RMarkdown file, which includes both walk-through explanation and code
- a PDF file, which was knitted from the RMarkdown file

If you are interested in the topic of decomposition, here you can find the PhD thesis by Vladimir Canudas-Romo: https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/10068144/thesis.pdf. It is an interesting, if challening, read.
